### Target Audience

There is no specific audience of this game. However, I would recommend that players are at least 5 years old.

### User Requirements and Expectations

- A simple, error-free game
- Straightforward navigation
- Game personalisation by entering the player's names
- Feedback on game results

### User Manual

<details><summary>Click here to view instructions</summary>

#### Main Menu
On the main menu, users are presented with an ASCII art rendering of the name 'Connect 4'. Below the welcome graphic there are a couple of options for user to select from.
Operation: Input a numeric value and press enter key.
1. View game rules
2. Play game

At any point of the game, if the user inputs a number which do not correspond to the available option then they will be prompt to try again.

#### Game rules
With the first option to view game rules, the users are presented with a short game rules and once read they can go back to the main menu.
Operation: Click any key and enter.

#### Play
With the Play Game option, users are asked if they have played the game before or not.
Operation: Input a numeric value and press enter key. 
The extra available option is to press 'y' key for 'yes' and 'n' for 'No'.
1. Yes
2. No

#### Log-in
When selecting option 1, users are asked to input their email addresses they used in the previous game, starting with the Player 1.

The email goes through a validation process. If the user inputs an email that has not been registered they have an option to either try another email or create a new user.
Operation: Input a numeric value and press enter key.
1. Try another email
2. Create a new player

User can try to input their email address until it matches the one already registered. If it does, then the greeting message with their name will be displayed.
If they forgot their email address they can create a new players by selecting the second option.

Same option follow for Player2.

#### New players registration (sign-up)
This option is available from the play option menu and during the existing users log-in.
Here you can sign up to create a new user.

Firstly, the Player1 is asked for their name follow by the email address. Both values go through the validation.

Username has to be between 2-12 characters long and contain only A-Z. It can already exist in the database.
Email: has to be a valid email containing exactly one @-sign from an existing domain. It must not exist in the database.

Same option follow for Player2.

If the registration is selected as part of the log-in option (Create a new player), then the relevant player will need to input their name and email address and once validated, type the email again for log in.

#### Users greeting

Once both users have been logged in, the program will display a greeting message with both names and start the game.

#### Game

Players take turns to make their moves.
The player to start is randomly selected by the program.
The current player's name is displayed beneath the blue board showing which piece they play with. Player has to select which column they want to locate their piece in.
Operation: Input a numeric value between 1 - 7 and press enter key.

A selection of invalid column will display a warning message and ask user to select a valid column.

The game continues until one of the players connect their four pieces.

When a player wins, a message with their name is shown on the screen.

Players have 4 different options to choose from:
1. Play again
2. Go to main menu
3. See your statistics
4. Quit game

Operation: Input a numeric value and press enter key.

#### Play again
By selecting this option a new game starts for the same players.

### Automated Testing
<details><summary>See unit testing</summary>

- I wrote unit tests using Python unittest library
- I tested separate functions to verify correct user input:
  - validation of user email and user name input

I needed to amend the function and add 'Try Except' blocks to handle TypeError.
Initial error called - 'TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()'


![User email unit test](docs/testing/unit-tests/email-validation-test.jpg)
![User name unit test](docs/testing/unit-tests/username-validation-test.jpg)

  - validation of data in log_in_players and register_new_players

When running the test initially, there was a TypeError called - 'TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable'. I handled this error by adding 'Try Except' blocks to both functions. This resulted with passed test.

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| When selecting 'go back to main menu' option after the game has finished, the game title was not displayed | Correct the function's indentation |
| When selecting a correct menu option after a few wrong numeric inputs the relevant game option was not called | Move the while loop at the top within the function |
| Underscores within the game title were not displayed after deployment to Heroku portal | Changed color settings for yellow & red |
| Gradient background color does not take up the full screen size | Add background-attachment property |
| Players names input values are not displayed in the game – instead of name a “‘Player1’’s / ‘Player2’’s move.” is shown | Reassign a value of player1name & player2name to the indexed-0 value (name) input by the user in ‘create_new_players’ function |
| Users input data was recorded in the same row in four columns instead of 2 separate rows | Created a list of players and while loop inside the 'register_new_players' function for Google Spreadsheet update separately for two players |
| There were quite a few errors and warnings related to exceeded number of characters in line, whitespace within a blank line, trailing white spaces or missing white spaces around operators | Split the comments or print functions into two separate rows maintaining correct indentation. Followed a guidance within pep8 online tool and corrected all warnings and errors |
